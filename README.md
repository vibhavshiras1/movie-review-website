# movie-review-website

This is a movie review website. We've used technologies like react, node, express and mongodb.
We have grouped movies under different genres. There are only a limited number of movies in this.
You'll have to login/signup to go through our website.
We have used mongodb as our database. It stores the information you give while signing up.

If you want to run the website on your desktop, make a folder and save 'app1.js' in that. Make another folder
inside the original folder and name it as 'views'.
Save all the other files that are there are in 'views'.
Go to CMD and navigate to the directory in which the original folder was saved.
Then, run 'node app1.js' in CMD.
Go the browser and type 'localhost:3000'.
